# Marking Criteria
Golden Path: (Tunnels → Tool → Droid → Bay → Crystal → Win). 
If player goes to the bay before doing tool on droid they gain 1 hazard count.

## A1. Functional Implementation & Gameplay Logic (10 marks)
**Criteria Codes:** SE-11-02, SE-11-06  

- **Extensive (10-9):**  
  - The game runs flawlessly.  
  - The golden path, all commands, scoring, and game state mechanics function exactly as required.  
  - Code is stable and handles errors gracefully.  

- **Thorough (8-7):**  
  - The game is fully playable with most core mechanics working correctly.  
  - Minor logic errors or inconsistencies may exist in secondary features (e.g., scoring, specific commands).  

- **Sound (6-5):**  
  - The game runs but has noticeable bugs.  
  - The golden path may be achievable, but some required commands or game logic are incomplete or faulty.  

- **Basic (4-3):**  
  - The program runs but is unstable or has significant functional gaps.  
  - Core gameplay is difficult or impossible to complete as intended.  

- **Elementary (2-1):**  
  - The code executes but fails on basic tasks.  
  - Little to no required functionality is present.  

- **Non-submission (0):**  
  - Non-attempt.

## A2. Object-Oriented Design & Principles (10 marks)
**Criteria Codes:** SE-11-01, SE-11-02, SE-11-08  

- **Extensive (10-9):**  
  - Sophisticated and clear application of OOP.  
  - All required classes are implemented with distinct roles.  
  - Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation are used effectively to create a modular and extensible design.  

- **Thorough (8-7):**  
  - Good application of OOP.  
  - Classes are implemented correctly, but there may be minor weaknesses in the design (e.g., a class with too many responsibilities, or less-than-ideal inheritance use).  

- **Sound (6-5):**  
  - Demonstrates a foundational understanding of OOP.  
  - Required classes are present but implementation may be inconsistent.  
  - Key principles like inheritance or encapsulation are attempted but not fully realised.  

- **Basic (4-3):**  
  - Code is largely procedural with some use of classes.  
  - Little evidence of OOP design principles (inheritance, encapsulation).  

- **Elementary (2-1):**  
  - Required classes are missing or used incorrectly.  
  - The structure does not reflect an object-oriented approach.  

- **Non-submission (0):**  
  - Non-attempt.

## A3. Code Craftsmanship & Readability (5 marks)
**Criteria Codes:** SE-11-01, SE-11-02, SE-11-06, SE-11-0  

- **Extensive (5):**  
  - Code is exceptionally clear, professionally formatted, and easy to follow.  
  - Naming conventions are consistent and descriptive.  
  - Comments are insightful and explain the "why," not the "what."  

- **Thorough (4):**  
  - Code is well-structured and readable.  
  - Only minor inconsistencies in formatting, naming, or commenting.  

- **Sound (3):**  
  - Code is generally readable but has inconsistent formatting, naming, or commenting.  
  - Occasionally hinders understanding.  

- **Basic (2):**  
  - Code is difficult to follow due to poor formatting, unclear logic, or a lack of meaningful names/comments.  

- **Elementary (1):**  
  - Code is highly disorganised and very difficult to comprehend.  

- **Non-submission (0):**  
  - Non-attempt.
